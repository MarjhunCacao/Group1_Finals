When you think about the types of jobs that will remain vital in the next century, engineers have to be near the top of the list. Engineers are the people who understand how everything works around us. They understand the combustion in your car engine, the proper approach and trajectory to land an orbiter on the moon, and how to program computers both inside and outside of our bodies to tell us what time it is, play us music, and help us live longer, more connected lives.

> [!TIP]
> Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost. The word engineer is derived from the Latin words ingeniare "to contrive, devise" and ingenium "cleverness".The foundational qualifications of a licensed professional engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations.

The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.

> [!NOTE]
> This isn’t simply a list of the most influential engineers alive today. Here we are focused on the number of citations and web presence of scholars in the last 10 years. There are other highly influential scholars who simply haven’t been cited and talked about as much in the last 10 years, whereas some new faces have been making a splash in the news, speaking events, and publishing, publishing, publishing. Our AI is time sensitive. To find some of the big names you might have expected to see here, we encourage you to use our dynamic ranking system and check influence over the past 20 and 50 years.
